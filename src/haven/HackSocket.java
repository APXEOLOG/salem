/*
 * This is horrible. This code exists to mitigate two bugs in Sun's
 * J2SE.
 *
 * First of all, the standard java.net.Socket implementation is not
 * interruptible per the standard Thread.interrupt mechanism. It is
 * very hard to see that as anything but a bug.
 *
 * Second of all, the java.nio.channels.SocketChannel has a bug on
 * Windows that prevents it from connecting to IPv6 addresses. (The
 * reason for that bug is most likely that Sun has two completely
 * different implementations for the java.net sockets and the NIO
 * sockets, that don't seem to share a single line of code, and they
 * probably missed one of the four functions for creating a socket
 * when making the code IPv6-capable, but that's an aside.)
 *
 * So where does this leave Haven, which uses thread interruption
 * heavily, if I want to be able to connect to IPv6 addresses? Well,
 * in hack-land, of course; where else?
